	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<p>My name is [UNSPECIFIED], also known on Youtube as Historically Innacurate! I used to make mapping videos such as the North Korean Civil War series, but now I focus on alternate history video essays. 
	<br></br>I cover scenarios such as "what if Japan was colonized?," or "What if Siberia was colonized?" to name a few. Although that's what most people know about me, I also develop games. 
	<br></br>I've only officially published one project though, but more are in the works. Anywho, thats enough intro, If you want to see some other stuff just scroll down!</p>

	<h1>My future plans</h1>
	<p>As of now I'm 13, and I want to pursue engineering or game development, of course with history as a side hobby. My main goal though is to start some kind of company/game development studio.</p>
	<p>In the vast field of engineering, I'm the most interested in methods of transportation such as trains, or energy generation via methods such as geothermal heat, water currents, etc.
	<br></br>If I do choose to pursue engineering, I hope to achieve some kind of breakthrough in the field of whichever interest I choose to invest my efforts in.</p>
	<p>If I choose game development over engineering, I want to start my own gamedev studio. I have experience in C++, python, and a little bit of Java, but the engine of my choice is Godot. 
	<br></br>I like 2d games the best, as in my opinion the constraint of 2 dimensions rather than 3 allows for clever mechanics. I plan on making an exploration based game in the near future, but I wont say the details yet.</p>

    	<h1>a little about me</h1>
    	<p>I live in a large American city, and am currently in the late 8th grade. I'm half Korean half American, with a little Mongolian in there as well. 
	<br></br>Something you probably didn't know about me is that I'm an amateur pianist, the hardest piece I know being Mantis lords from Hollow Knight. 
	<br></br>It's a really fun peice I'll leave a link to it here:</p>
